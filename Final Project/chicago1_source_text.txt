Afugitive apprehension unit is on the lookout for a 19-year-old robbery suspect who sneaked out of a courtroom at the Leighton Criminal Court Building on Friday morning by possibly slipping off handcuffs, officials said.
It happened about 10:45 a.m. when Alicia Gines, 19, was in a courtroom facing another escape charge from September that stemmed from a robbery case, said Cara Smith, chief policy officer for Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart.
“She was AWOL since September 25 and yesterday, Chicago police arrested her on a warrant,’’ Smith said.
After spending the night behind bars, she was brought directly to a judge’s courtroom Friday morning.
“About 10:45 a.m. she left the courtroom,’’ Smith said, adding that jail footage captured a picture of her walking right out of the courthouse in the 2600 block of South California Avenue.
Smith said they were trying to find out how this happened and if she actually had cuffs on.
“Initially, the report was she had handcuffs on, but it’s hard to get out of handcuffs,’’ Smith said.
Gines, who has a pending robbery case as well, remained on the lam Friday night.
“Our fugitive and apprehension units are looking for her,” Smith said.
Smith said when they do find Gines, of the 5300 block of South Maplewood Avenue, she will be facing two escape charges. If convicted, those have to be served consecutively, Smith said.
Gines’ first arrest warrant was issued Sept. 25, after she escaped her electronic monitoring, Smith said. She’d been placed on the EM program in October 2017 for the pending robbery charge.
