Final Project Reflection

1. I used the text of the book "harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban chapter 1", which is 
   written by J.K. Rowling, and compared that to 4 other texts which were: chapter 1 summary of
   hamlet from sparksnote, a news article about ISIS from CNN, my personal essay for environmental 
   cilmate and earth about Cape Code, and the chapter 3 summary of montana 1948 from litchart.

2. the result showed me that my essay about the Cape Cod is more likely to have come from rowling

3. I do not think that my program is perfect. I can improve this program by considering and adding
   more possible stemming features, and by adding more dictionary features to the program.
