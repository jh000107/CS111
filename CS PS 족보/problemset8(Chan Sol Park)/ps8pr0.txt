Q) What are the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing a strategy of evolving programs 
   to solve problems, rather than writing them for a specific task?

	The advantage of pursuing a strategy of evolving programs to solve problem is that
	the program can function very accurately. Most of the times, it will be more accurate
	than human and also solve problems much faster than humans. However, there is some
	disadvantages of evolving programs to solve problems. It is that programs cannot
	make decisions similar, or as same as humans. They do not have morality or generosity 
	like humans. This may cause the programs to do things that humans do not want.
