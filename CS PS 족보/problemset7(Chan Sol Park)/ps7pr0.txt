1. In light of the reading, make an argument for how computational models help and/or hurt 
   society. You are welcome to stake out a middle position, or to take a strong stand on 
   either side. Just make sure that your argument is informed by the reading.

	I strongly believe that computational models can greatly support the human society. 
	It may be true that because the current computational models are not perfect and may
	create few errors, it could make scientists to make wrong decisions. However, I believe
	that technologies, including the computational models, will develop rapidly and those
	errors will be covered. In the future, computational models will make more innovative
	technologies without causing any causalities. 


2. Based on the information in the articles, how can computer scientists and others who 
   develop computational models ensure that their models are correct? Is it even possible 
   to do so?
	
	It is not possible to do so, because nothing can be perfect. No matter how
	careful those scientists were, there will be mistakes. However, the goal of
	those scientists is to eradicate as many mistakes as possible and minimize
	the negative impacts of the computational models.
