1. Kurzweil views technology as a fundamentally positive force in human development. Is his 
   vision of the future one that you would look forward to? Why or why not?

	Yes. Some people say that the Earth's resource is finite. Therefore, in the future,
	when Earth's resources deplete, people will be out of food and have extremely
	difficult time to endure their lives. However, I believe that the technology can
	create infinite resources and develop human society.


2. Kurzweil has a track record of remarkable inventions and successful predictions. Do you 
   believe the predictions cited in this article? Why or why not?
	
	Yes, because some of his important predictions were correct and I highly agree
	with his thoughts on technology. Certainly, not all of his predictions are not 
	correct and are not going to be correct. However,I absolutely agree that 
	technology will positively develop human society.
