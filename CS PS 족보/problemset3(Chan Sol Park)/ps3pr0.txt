1. What was the most interesting or important idea in this article for you ? and why?
The idea that computer science can be used for medical purposes was interesting. 
Before, I thought computer science can only be used to develop computers and other 
electronic devices. However, after reading this article, I realized that in the future,
computers can improve human health gradually. 


2. Which homework problem that we¡¯ve done so far would you describe as being closest 
   to the kinds of problems solved by the DNA computers mentioned in the article? Why?
Question 4 and 5 in problem 6 (fun with recursions ||) in problem set 2 were similar 
to the idea presented in this article. In these questions, programs were set to 
convert DNA values to RNA values when a string is given. Questions 4 program was coded 
to convert a single letter (character) of a DNA value to RNA and question 5 program was
coded to convert a string that contains multiple letters of DNA values to RNA values.
