1. Which contributing factor within the bug¡¯s origins (there are many!) strikes you as the 
  ¡°most preventable¡± and why? Of course, this will be in hindsight.

	One of the bugs that seemed to be most preventable was the diagnostice error message,
	which was made by the on-board computer that tried to convert one huge data from a 
	64 bit format to a 16 bit format. The computer should not have converted the data
	or split the data into multiple pieces then conver them to 16 bit formats. This
	error seems possible to be fixed by adding little more codes and drives. 


2. The investigative report that uncovered the bug stated that software ¡°does not fail in 
   the same sense as a mechanical system.¡± Do you agree or disagree with this statement? 
   Explain briefly.

	I agree with this statement because I believe that there are many differences
	between the system in mechanics and the system in the real world. In the mechanical
	system, everything is perfectly calculated. So everything would go as expected,
	following calculations. However, in the real world, nothing can be perfectly
	calculated. There are always errors and those errors grealt impact the calculations. 
	Therefore, when applying mechanic system to real world, people should always expect
	to have unexpceted errors to occur.
