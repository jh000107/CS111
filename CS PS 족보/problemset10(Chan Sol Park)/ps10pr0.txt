1. Suppose that pivot searching were readily available to you. To what extent could you imagine 
   using it? Do you feel it would make you more productive ? or would this type of search remain 
   largely unused in the way you interact with computation and electronic materials?

	I would be using it to study and do much better in any exams or tests, which require
	tremendous amount of memorizations. The time for students to study will be shortened
	and more students will do much better in any courses. Memorizing words, stories, facts,
	and any information will be done much quickly and easily by any students. Thus, the
	society's education level will also develop. 


2. In the conference paper on pivot searching, the authors point out that the approach may 
   especially help particular types of professionals, e.g., it would allow doctors ¡°to search on 
   the context (symptoms) of other patients, thus discovering diagnoses, treatments and other 
   relevant information¡± and would allow lawyers to ¡°leverage a context search tool based on 
   cases, allowing them to search on client name, arguments made, resources cited, and then 
   seeing the contexts in which they were applied.¡± Do you find these imagined applications 
   believable and/or compelling? Could you imagine other endeavors where context-based searches 
   would be even more beneficial?

	If pivot system or the context-based searching programming works perfectly, it can benefit 
	the society and people almost in any subjects. Furthurmore, what this system can benefit
	the most would be alzheimer or any loss of memory. It can prevent old people getting 
	the disease and losing their memoeries or any people who lost their memories due to
	accidents.
