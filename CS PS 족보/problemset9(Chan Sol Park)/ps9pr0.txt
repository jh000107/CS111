1. The article claims that researchers have been ¡°fine-tuning a computer system that is 
   trying to master semantics by learning more like a human.¡± Based on the article and 
   your own experiences programming computers (in circuit diagrams, assembly language, 
   and Python), how do computers operate and learn differently from the way humans do? 
   Are there any similarities?

	one of the biggest differences between how humans learn and how computers learn is that
	computer's learning depends on human knowledge. Computer and its technology develops
	as human knowledge developes. Humans apply their knowledge to computer. On the other hand,
	humans learn by themselves.They teach each others and learn together. Humans learn effectively
	when they learn together, but computers always learn individually. 


2. The NELL system had to have human help in order to avoid the cascade of mistaken 
   conclusions from the statement, ¡°I deleted my Internet cookies.¡± Do you believe 
   machine-learning systems (like NELL or others) will always need human assistance such 
   as this, or will they be able to overcome such problems in the future? Give a brief 
   explanation for your thoughts.

	In my opinion, they will always need human help to function correctly.
	It is because computers are made by humans. Therefore, they cannot be perfect.
	There always will be mistakes of codes and programming in the computers. 
	No matter how much the computers and technology develops, computers will always
	need human assisstance to function perfectly.
