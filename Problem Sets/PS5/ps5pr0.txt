1. Kurzweil views technology as a fundamentally positive force in human development. Is his vision of the future one that you would look forward to? Why or why not?

Yes, I totally agree that technology is a fundamentally positive force in human development. Technology is something that human desired for centuries and we developed it in order to make the human life easier. However, now we have questions like losing jobs and all that but I still think that developing technology is actually bringing in more jobs and opportunities. Technology is directly related to human's longevity and simply a better future. Without technology, in this world having finite resource, we would not be able to survive. Technology is something that is required in our lives.

2. Kurzweil has a track record of remarkable inventions and successful predictions. Do you believe the predictions cited in this article? Why or why not?

I believe the predictions cited in this article. He is definitely an experienced researcher in this field, and I am sure that he is making all these predictions based on his own research and experiences. All the technological developments that these people achieved are still unbelievable and I am sure that all these nonsense scientific predictions would be present in near future.
