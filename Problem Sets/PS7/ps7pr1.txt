2.
a) Write an assignment statement that replaces the value of 8 in this 2-D list with a value of 16.

twoD[2][1] = 16

b) Write a code fragment that uses a loop to print the values in the rightmost column of the 2-D list to which twoD refers. Print each value on its own line.

for r in range(len(twoD)):
    for c in [-1]:
        print(twoD[r][c])

c) Write a code fragment that uses one or more loops to print the values in the diagonal of the list to which twoD refers â€“ i.e., the values along a diagonal line from the upper-left corner to the lower-right corner. Print each value on its own line.

for r in range(len(twoD)):
    for c in [r]:
        print(twoD[r][c])
