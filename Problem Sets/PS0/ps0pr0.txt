\f0\fs24 \cf0 I think the most important idea in this article is the idea of \'a1\'b0human-centered computing\'a1\'b1. I believe that this idea relates to the very fundamental of computer science, or even more in general, of machine: making something easier for humanity. When nonscientists hear the word computer science, it often sounds complicated and difficult. However, I believe, as a future computer scientist, that it is a common duty for computer scientists to make programs that are \'a1\'b0powerful and approachable.\'a1\'b1 I also really like the program itself that it makes possible people to express the unique feeling of watercolor on computer screen, but I got impressed a lot on the point that it computer science itself is getting more approachable to public.}
