Suppose that pivot searching were readily available to you. To what extent could you imagine using it? Do you feel it would make you more productive – or would this type of search remain largely unused in the way you interact with computation and electronic materials?

	I think that YouPivot would be really useful in our daily lives. However, I think this connects to the fundamental issue of contemporary, where our privacy gets invaded by internet. I am definitely sure that this system is going to make me more productive, however, I would be afraid to use it because this basically means I am getting tracked all the time. Even though we could decide which points we are going to be tracked on, it is still somewhat creepy.

In the conference paper on pivot searching, the authors point out that the approach may especially help particular types of professionals, e.g., it would allow doctors “to search on the context (symptoms) of other patients, thus discovering diagnoses, treatments and other relevant information” and would allow lawyers to “leverage a context search tool based on cases, allowing them to search on client name, arguments made, resources cited, and then seeing the contexts in which they were applied.” Do you find these imagined applications believable and/or compelling? Could you imagine other endeavors where context-based searches would be even more beneficial?

	I find these imagined applications absolutely believable. By using the pivot searching, doctors would be easier to relate one disease to others and save a lot of time.   I believe music producers could also use this system when they are trying to figure out the songs, patterns, or rhythms. This may require more specific skills.
