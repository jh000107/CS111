1. What was the most interesting or important idea in this article for you - and why?

I think the most interesting idea in this article is the capability of DNA-based computers in the way they can "cure or kill cells which are such or in trouble." I believe this is a revolutionary discovery in medical history as well. By being able to control specific areas within a program, there would be a broader scope of area that a program could contribute in various applications. Also, I always find something astonishing when researchers make a new "way" to approach an existing language. As what the article says, the new way to compute simple operations is so exciting.

2. Which homework problem that weâ€™ve done so far would you describe as being closest to the kinds of problems solved by the DNA computers mentioned in the article? Why?

From the homework problems that we've done so far, I would describe recursive functions-related problems as being closest to the kinds of problems solved by the DNA computers. Since the DNA computers are suited for executing such detailed codes, I think they would be perfect for going through all the specific conditions that a recursive function contains. Specifically, when a function needs list comprehensions involving recursion functions, preciseness of the DNA computers would definitely help a big program to execute complicated functions.
