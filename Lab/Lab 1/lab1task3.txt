1. Assignment statements, Print statements
2. Statements are executed from top to bottom.
3. The variable course has not been assigned a value yet, but if it has a value, it adds one to its original value and the statement 'print' prints whatever you put between the quotation marks and prints the value for variable course as well.
Therefore, the output would be:

maybe you will take CS 112 next semester

if we assume that the value for the variable course is 111.

4. 
a) The difference between weeks and 'weeks' is that weeks is a variable while 'weeks' is just a string that gets printed out as weeks.
b) The program print 5 weeks instead of 6 or 5.7142... because the user used integer division, which only prints out integers.
c) We could add another variable called daysLeft and assign it as daysLeft = days % 7 and print the value with appropriate prompt so that the readers could see weeks and remaining days.

6. The program has an error and it stops me from running the program.
